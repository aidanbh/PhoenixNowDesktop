# PhoenixNow Desktop

This program is an unofficial cross-platform client for the open-source [PhoenixNow IP-based attendance system](https://github.com/ECGHelloWorld/PhoenixNow), used by the Early College at Guilford uppperclassmen to register attendance at Guilford for GCS attendance purposes.

#### Requirements
The latest version of the Oracle Java SE 8 Java Runtime Environment must be installed. The system should support the Java AWT SystemTray interface for full functionality. Obviously, a connection (Internet or otherwise) to the PhoenixNow server is required.
